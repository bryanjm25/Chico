## ISELCO Consumer Feedback Analysis Using SVM

## Overview
This project involves building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to analyze and classify consumer feedback data sourced from the official Facebook page of ISELCO. The objective is to understand consumer sentiments effectively through machine learning techniques.

## Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Model components saved**:
  - Encoder
  - Model
  - Scaler
  - Vectorizer

## Dataset and Preprocessing
The dataset comprises consumer feedback collected via web scraping from ISELCO's official Facebook account. Before model training, extensive data preprocessing was carried out to ensure data quality and suitability, including:
- Tokenization
- Punctuation removal
- Text normalization
- Stop word removal
- Lemmatization
These preprocessing steps enhance the accuracy and performance of the SVM model by cleaning and standardizing textual data.

## Performance Evaluation
- The included learning curve image illustrates the training and validation performance of the model over iterations.
- Confusion Matrix and Classification Report (both provided as images) give detailed insights into model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Work
Potential improvements include expanding data sources, fine-tuning model parameters, and exploring other machine learning algorithms to boost predictive performance.
